We could start with some recent components of reparations others will be familiar with. 

Next we need to take individuals through their awakening that small things like nypd commissioner apologizing last june it the first requirement that must be included in repartitions as the UN defines them. How do we bring a clip of that apology and Trudeau’s from Canada’s 20 minute apology and detailing of human rights violation (another ingredient UN requires) to this project.

Why do I want this as an app not a website. Everyone owns their own copy of the Bible, New Testament or koran. They need to reread this until at their own pace to drink in a reality we are currently watching happen without saying the words blatantly.

I thought about doing this in conjunction with my local database holders of all who marched in the world pride events this June. We should compliment their efforts and the LGBT centers, and Sages, plus Free&Equal so we break the door that’s is preventing the world court from offering a decision to end excluision. A lot of information needs to live here. The companion website will host lengthy research but app needs to be in lay,mans terms. My sister built the first Monopoly website for the board game at 16. I’m asking all of you to tackle your fair portion of our human rights crime submission. 

There would not have been 2017 & 2019 legislation introduced for equality refunds of taxes if pour rights were not still being infringed.
